## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT PRIORITIES

### 1. **Fix CrashLoopBackOff Issues** üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY
Several critical services are failing:
```
narrative-analyzer-5549745c88-92cqq              CrashLoopBackOff    
narrative-analyzer-7fb9d67cfc-q77vv              CrashLoopBackOff    
realtime-materialized-updater-cc8b87549-q6h4w    CrashLoopBackOff    
```

**Action Required:**
- Investigate narrative-analyzer pod logs
- Fix materialized updater crash issue  
- Ensure LLM integration stability

### 2. **Clean Up Failed Jobs** üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY
Many jobs are stuck with `ErrImageNeverPull`:
```
premium-ohlc-collection-job-* (12 jobs)
comprehensive-ohlc-collection-*
enhanced-materialized-test-*
```

**Action Required:**
- Delete failed jobs to clean up cluster
- Fix image availability issues
- Ensure proper job scheduling

### 3. **Validate ML Features Pipeline** üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY
After onchain repair, validate ML features are properly populated:

**Action Required:**
- Test materialized_updater_fixed.py with improved onchain data
- Verify 10 onchain fields now populate in ml_features_materialized
- Confirm 29.9% ‚Üí 35%+ ML feature population improvement

### 4. **Complete Onchain Data Restoration** üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY
Currently only 8.3% of onchain data restored:

**Action Required:**
- Expand onchain_data_enhanced to include more historical data
- Monitor onchain collector for continued data flow
- Target 50%+ restoration of onchain enhanced data

## üìä TECHNICAL DEEP DIVES

### A. **Narrative Analyzer Investigation**
The narrative-analyzer pods are critical for LLM integration:

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Check pod logs: `kubectl logs narrative-analyzer-xxx -n crypto-collectors`
2. Verify LLM service connectivity
3. Check resource limits and dependencies
4. Validate Ollama integration

### B. **Materialized Updater Optimization**
With cleaned database and fixed onchain pipeline:

**Optimization Steps:**
1. Test current materialized_updater_fixed.py performance
2. Validate onchain field population improvement
3. Monitor 15-minute CronJob execution
4. Measure ML feature completeness improvement

### C. **Premium API Utilization**
Ensure we're getting full benefit from CoinGecko Premium:

**Validation Steps:**
1. Monitor API call patterns in enhanced-crypto-prices logs
2. Confirm premium endpoints being used
3. Track rate limiting improvements
4. Measure data collection reliability gains

3. **API Rate Limits** - Monitor premium API usage patterns
4. **Resource Constraints** - Multiple service improvements may stress cluster

---

## üèÅ IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

**Right Now:** Fix narrative-analyzer CrashLoopBackOff
**Next 30min:** Clean up failed jobs
**Next 1 hour:** Validate ML feature improvements
**Next 2 hours:** Complete onchain data expansion
**End of day:** Full system health validation

The system is in a much better state after cleanup and premium API upgrade. The main focus now is resolving the service crashes and completing the onchain data restoration to unlock the full potential of the enhanced ML features pipeline.
